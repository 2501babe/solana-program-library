XXX OK what the FUCK am i doing
this has not fucking worked so far im fucking pissed
i have been trying to do this bottom up by moving code over and making it more general
stupid fucking idea. i think i need to work top down for this shit

which means. i need to figure out um

...

basically i need a generic framework for testing both sorts of pools
shared functionality like
* set up the pool
* make a stake account
* check what the balance is supposed to be
* check our acocunts look right

i want to do this with test-case
umm. ok. so the other thing is what am i calling everything
* pool/single-pool/multi-pool
* intermediary/passthrough/pool
both of these are confusing tho because they imply something plural is singular
eg "single" pool actually has many stakes, just one validator
likewise with "intermediary"
its not a single and a multi it's like... a mux and a mux+demux? lol

anyway fucking who cares. call it cow and horse. whatever
i want two accounts structs, like i have in both test setups
and then a trait over them that has all the useful functions on it
